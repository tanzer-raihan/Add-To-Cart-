This one has been made to demonstrate how we can use browser's  local storage to store data. Put your desirable items name on the input section and add this to your cart. You can see your listed items on the left side of the interface. The data you add will be stored permanently on the browser as long as you don't delete it or place the order. Many things can be done, however I didn't. To see more use of local storage, visit the amajhon one. Thank you.
